# 1. Prepare Your Microservice Code
# Ensure that your microservice application code is ready for deployment. It should include:

# A working source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
# A Dockerfile or a supported build framework (e.g., for Java, Python, Node.js, etc.).

# 2. Install OpenShift CLI (oc)
# Download and install the oc command-line tool to interact with OpenShift from your terminal.

# Installation guide: https://docs.openshift.com/container-# platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html

# 3. Login into OpenShift

oc login <openshift-cluster-url>

# 4. Create new namespace/project

oc new-project my-microservice

# 5. Select a Base S2I Builder Image

oc get imagestreams -n openshift

Select the appropriate base image for your microservice.

# 6. Deploy Your Microservice Using S2I
# Use the oc new-app command to initiate an S2I build from your source code. For example, if you have a Node.js application:

oc new-app --name=my-node-microservice nodejs~https://github.com/user/repository.git

# Replace nodejs with the correct builder image for your application (e.g., python, java, etc.). The new-app command will:
# Clone the repository.
# Build the application image using the S2I process.
# Deploy the microservice.

# 7. Check the Build and Deployment Status
# After the build process is triggered, you can monitor it using:

oc logs -f bc/my-node-microservice

# 8. Expose Your Microservice
# Expose your microservice by creating a route so it can be accessed externally.

oc expose svc/my-node-microservice

# You can now access your microservice using the route URL created by OpenShift.

# 9. Manage Scaling and Updates
# OpenShift automatically manages scaling, health checks, and rolling updates. You can scale your microservice easily using the following command:

oc scale --replicas=3 deployment/my-node-microservice

# 10. View and Manage Microservices in OpenShift Web Console
# You can view your application in the OpenShift Web Console, monitor logs, and review build history.
